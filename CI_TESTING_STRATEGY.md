# CI/CD Testing Strategy for macOS Build Fix

## üéØ Objective
Test the macOS build fix using GitHub Actions without releasing to production.

## üìã Testing Approach

### Phase 1: Create Test Branch
```bash
# Create a test branch for CI validation
git checkout -b test/macos-build-fix-alpha-6-1
git add .
git commit -m "test: macOS build fix implementation for alpha.6.1

- Enhanced electron-builder config with native module support
- Added prepare-native-deps.js script with platform detection  
- Updated package.json with all macOS optional dependencies
- Enhanced GitHub Actions with native module handling
- Improved Homebrew formula with postflight fixes"

git push origin test/macos-build-fix-alpha-6-1
```

### Phase 2: Monitor CI/CD Results
Watch the GitHub Actions workflow at:
`https://github.com/happenings-community/requests-and-offers-kangaroo-electron/actions`

**Expected Outcomes:**
- ‚úÖ **macos-13 (x64)**: Build should complete successfully with native modules
- ‚úÖ **macos-latest (ARM64)**: Build should complete successfully with native modules  
- ‚úÖ **windows-2022**: Should continue working (no regression)
- ‚úÖ **ubuntu-22.04**: Should continue working (no regression)

**Key Validation Points:**
1. Native module installation steps execute without critical errors
2. DMG files are generated for both macOS architectures
3. File sizes are reasonable (native modules included)
4. No regression in other platforms

### Phase 3: Artifact Validation
Download the generated DMG files and:
1. Check file structure includes unpacked native modules
2. Verify DMG size increase (indicates native modules bundled)
3. Share with macOS beta testers for installation testing

## üîç What to Monitor in CI Logs

### Success Indicators:
```
‚úÖ Installing platform-specific native dependencies...
‚úÖ npm install --save-optional @holochain/hc-spin-rust-utils-darwin-arm64@0.500.0
‚úÖ npm rebuild @holochain/hc-spin-rust-utils --update-binary
‚úÖ Module loaded successfully
‚úÖ Build completed successfully
```

### Warning Patterns (Acceptable):
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Module load test failed - may be expected in CI
‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to install ARM64 package (on x64 runner)
```

### Failure Patterns (Need Investigation):
```
‚ùå Cannot find module '@holochain/hc-spin-rust-utils'
‚ùå electron-builder failed
‚ùå ASAR archive error
```

## üö® Rollback Plan
If CI fails:
1. Revert specific problematic changes
2. Test incrementally (one fix at a time)
3. Fall back to original plan implementation
4. Consider alternative approaches (electron-rebuild, different asarUnpack patterns)
